Before asking a question, please make sure to check:

- The README
- The `docs/` directory at the root of the project

Especially if you are using a **Coding Agent (e.g. Claude Code, Codex CLI, etc.)**,  
specifying the `docs/` directory as the investigation target and letting the agent explore
the specifications and behavior from there may help it arrive at an answer or identify the cause of an issue.
