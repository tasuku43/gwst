# Security Policy

Thank you for helping keep gion and its users safe.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please **do not** report security vulnerabilities via public GitHub issues.

Preferred (private):
- Use **GitHub Security Advisories**: create a private report from the repository “Security” tab.

If you cannot use GitHub Security Advisories:
- Open a GitHub issue **without sensitive details** and ask maintainers for a private channel to continue.

## What to include

- Affected component / command
- Impact (what an attacker can do)
- Reproduction steps (proof-of-concept if available)
- Affected versions / commit SHA (if known)
- Any mitigations or workarounds

## Maintainer response process

- This project is maintained by an individual maintainer on a best-effort basis.
- I aim to acknowledge reports within **7 days** (best effort).
- I will investigate, prepare a fix, and coordinate disclosure timing with the reporter when possible.
- If a release is needed, I will publish a fix via GitHub Releases (see `docs/ops/RELEASING.md`).

## Supported versions

We typically support the latest released version. If you are using an older version, we may ask you to reproduce the issue on the latest release.
